# Dynamic Optimization

## What is Dynamic Optimization?
---
Dynamic optimization seeks to find the set of integer positions that minimizes the standard deviation of tracking error against the ideal float positions. 

### Goals
- [ ] Build out robust unittesting to help identify and mitigate any potential rooms for propegating data errors
- [ ] Integrate risk limits into the algorithm
- [ ] Rewrite the algorithm (maybe using simulated annealing) to increase efficiency potentially breaking down the math of the algorithm...
- [ ] **OR** switch to a faster programming language such as Rust or C++
